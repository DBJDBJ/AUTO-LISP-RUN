AutoLISP system of plugins. Aim was to standardise the quality of numerous little AutoLISP written utilities. Possibly by dozens, or more authors.
Thus enabling (Auto)CAD administrators to quickly introduce them to the local population of users. 
Plug ins are called "RUN's" and are implemented as AutoLISP files with the extension "RUN". 
Requires running AutoCAD and AutoLISP.
